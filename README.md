    This is a hobby project for my own portfolio. Since I am an huge apple fan i thought
    it was a good idea to create a page looking like a mac screen. The different elements
    on the page is meant to look like elements you would find on a mac screen.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://www.figma.com/proto/QlqAgKyGtFI5JBNlIPcWPH/Francin-Portfolio?page-id=0%3A1&node-id=1%3A2&viewport=241%2C48%2C0.24&scaling=scale-down&starting-point-node-id=1%3A2)

By clicking the image above you can try the prototype out. The prototype is designed in Figma. I always start every project by designing the layout in figma. I have got to experience that this decreases the development time, and the process is more streamlined. 

As mentioned I chose to go for a design looking like a mac screen. I thought this would be a fun challenge! I focused also on implementing all components and styling myself instead of using any third party component libraries. The app is written in TypeScript and will be deployed to Heroku when finished.
