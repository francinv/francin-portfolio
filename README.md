    This is a hobby project for my own portfolio. Since I am an huge Apple fan I thought
    it was a good idea to create a page looking like a mac screen. The different elements
    on the page is meant to look like elements you would find on a mac screen.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://francin.vercel.app)

By clicking the image above you will be sent to the deployed application. My idea was to create a website that looked like a Mac desktop. This challenge was very fun and I got to test my styling skills. I have created all the components and styling myself, instead of using any third party component libraries.

The application is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) and has been deployed to [Vercel](https://vercel.com). GitHub statistics, my most used languages, my repositories and an image of me are fetched from GitHub using their GraphQL API. This was the first time I used GraphQL and it was exciting to see the advantages of using it.

I have written comment for the code, if it is any questions regarding the code or the project itself please feel free to <a href="#contact">contact me.</a>

These views are used to display my projects at github. The initial view is the gallery view, which shows a social image of the repository and some statistics. By clicking the image you will be redirected to the specific repository. If you toggle to the symbol view, you will only see finder icons with the name of the repository.
